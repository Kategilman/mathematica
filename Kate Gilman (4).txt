------------- Comments ---------------
(-0.25) Break up all lines longer than 80 characters.
(-1) The file and class should be named DisjointSetForest, not DisjointForestSet.
(-1) In iteratePixels, you consider the 0th row and column 'out of bounds' and thus do not connect them to neighboring pixels, causing incorrect returns in the number of segments.
